# DEECo-Timing-Analysis

Master Thesis at Charles University in Prague

Prototype of the analysis tool to identify outdating of variables due to delays caused by scheduling and communication in real-time systems. Analysis is done over a DEECo semantics build over Ensemble-Based Component System (EBCS) semantics because it enables precise specification and analysis of important properties. The main benefit of the analysis is detection of situations in which data processed in RDS are outdated and can cause incorrect behavior of particular components.
